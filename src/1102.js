/**
 * Given an m x n integer matrix grid, return the maximum score of a path starting
 * at (0, 0) and ending at (m - 1, n - 1) moving in the 4 cardinal directions.
 *
 * The score of a path is the minimum value in that path.
 *
 *  * For example, the score of the path 8 → 4 → 5 → 9 is 4.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * [https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/08/05/maxgrid1.jpg]
 *
 *
 * Input: grid = [[5,4,5],[1,2,6],[7,4,6]]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: The path with the maximum score is highlighted in yellow.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * [https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/08/05/maxgrid2.jpg]
 *
 *
 * Input: grid = [[2,2,1,2,2,2],[1,2,2,2,1,2]]
 * Output: 2
 *
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 * [https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/08/05/maxgrid3.jpg]
 *
 *
 * Input: grid = [[3,4,6,3,4],[0,2,1,1,7],[8,8,3,2,7],[3,2,4,9,8],[4,1,2,0,0],[4,6,5,4,3]]
 * Output: 3
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *  * m == grid.length
 *  * n == grid[i].length
 *  * 1 <= m, n <= 100
 *  * 0 <= grid[i][j] <= 109
